      <description>Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s most important achievement was his extension and mathematical formulation of Michael Faraday&amp;rsquo;s theories of electricity and magnetic lines of force. His paper On Faraday&amp;rsquo;s lines of force was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in two parts, 1855 and 1856. Maxwell showed that a few relatively simple mathematical equations could express the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interrelation.
The four partial differential equations, now known as Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations, first appeared in fully developed form in Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873).</description>
