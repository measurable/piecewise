## Abstract

A growing body of evidence supports the contention of scholarly culture theory that immersing children in book-oriented environments benefits their later educational achievement, attainment and occupational standing.

These findings have been interpreted as suggesting that book-oriented socialization, indicated by home library size, equips youth with life-long tastes, skills and knowledge.

Here, we document advantageous effects of scholarly culture for adult literacy, adult numeracy, and adult technological problem solving. Growing up with home libraries boosts adult skills in these areas beyond the benefits accrued from parental education or own educational or occupational attainment.

The effects are loglinear, with greatest returns to the growth in smaller libraries.

## 1. Introduction

How does culture enhance life chances?

**Bourdieu's argument**:
The most prominent theory of this tradition, Bourdieu's argument about *cultural reproduction*, builds on Max Weber's insight into the importance of culture in boundary maintenance by elite status groups. It posits that elite families equip their children with “widely shared, high status cultural signals (attitudes, preferences, formal knowledge, behaviours, goods and credentials) used for cultural exclusion”  thereby securing educational advantages for their children and reducing opportunities for other children.

**empirical studies**:
A host of empirical studies inspired by this argument conclude that cultural capital, misconstrued by teachers as academic excellence, provides elite children with unfair advantages in securing desirable socioeconomic outcomes. Importantly, this tradition assumes that the high-status cultural signals are linked to a monolithic highbrow culture.

**dimensionality of high culture**:
However, every test of the dimensionality of high culture finds not one, but rather two distinctive groupings: a books and reading-related dimension and a beaux arts/arts appreciation/arts spectatorship dimension. Building on this distinction, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that when book-related forms of cultural resources are distinguished from other forms, the former and not the latter account for much of educational success. This is because book-related resources have a substantive link to academic-related skills such as vocabulary building, counterfactual thinking, and cognitive flexibility, whereas highbrow arts consumption or extracurricular activities have no substantive impact on academic skills.

In short, *scholarly culture* is separate from *arts spectatorship* and, moreover,

- scholarly culture has a major impact on educational performance and attainment,
- but arts spectatorship has little or no effect.

This is important because

- it undermines the claim that cultural resources are arbitrary signals used by the elite to exclude or disadvantage others:
- instead, highbrow arts (the arbitrary signals) are of little or no importance to education, while engagement in book-related culture raises educational attainment.

The implication, which we shall examine here, is that scholarly culture endows children with cognitive skills that intrinsically enhance academic performance, rather than scholarly culture being merely an arbitrary signal of elite membership.

Another important aspect of the scholarly culture theory is its proposition that involvement in books and reading *benefits most disadvantaged children and not the children of the elite*. This contrasts with cultural reproduction theory and builds on the cultural mobility model, as detailed below.

### goal of the paper

Our goals in this paper are

1. to validate the scholarly culture hypothesis in the context of new outcomes that are essential to the claim of intrinsic connection between book-oriented childhoods and educational and occupational success, ...
2. to illuminate the inter-- and intra--generational mechanisms through which scholarly culture operates. We will also consider, more speculatively, if culture conceptualized thus is likely to remain relevant in the era of digital literacy.

## 2. Cultural reproduction versus scholarly culture

### 2.1. Cultural reproduction

Cultural reproduction arguments, building on Bourdieu, suggest that elite parents strategize to equip their children with cultural signals which teachers mistake for academic excellence and hence invest more in educating the elite offspring.

Researchers followed Bourdieu in distinguishing three states of so understood cultural capital, namely

- **the embodied capital** which involves legitimate preferences and behaviours,
- **the objectified capital** such as books and other transmittable physical goods and
- **the institutionalised capital** that involves educational credentials and other indicators of class position.

It is commonly assumed that embodied capital is necessary for the objectified capital to be mobilised and effectively used for enhancing one's institutionalised capital.

- Theoretically, cultural capital involves a range of elite status signals that is too broad to operationalize, hence references to Bourdieu “wild”.

- In contrast, empirical research usually focuses on the participation in the highbrow culture or Bourdieu's “domesticated” capital, which involves *educational resources*, *cultural involvement*, *extracurricular activities*, and *reading climates*, with exposure to and possession of books treated merely as one of its many possible indicators.

- Importantly, high status culture is seen as monolithic, with all the aspects from reading to attendance at art galleries being interchangeable indicators.

Research in this tradition aims to demonstrate that educational inequalities are maintained by elite parents who invest in cultural capital to prime their offspring for socio--economic success regardless of their academic ability.

**the cultural mobility tradition**:
By contrast, the cultural mobility tradition, instigated by DiMaggio, rejects the logic of cultural reproduction theory arguing that *it is the children from the lowest socio--economic origins, and not the elite, who benefit most from endowment with cultural resources*.
This tradition accords with the view that scholarly culture endows children with cognitive skills, intellectual flexibility, and problem--solving capacity that endure throughout their lives.
These cognitive skills rather than arbitrary cultural signals of elite status are what translates scholarly cultural endowment into educational and occupational success.

### 2.2. Scholarly culture

*Scholarly culture theory* highlights *book-oriented socialization, indicated by adolescents' home library size*, as a source of cognitive competencies, skills and knowledge that are *valued not only in formal education but also by employers in different places and historical periods*.
Scholarly culture does not comprise arbitrary cultural signals that identify elite members and earmark them for privileged positions in society: it enhances performance and as such it is valued in various historical circumstances and by modest families as well as the elite.

#### 2.2.1. Scholarly culture as social practice and way of life

While *the exact processes through which scholarly culture accrues may vary*, they involve "*social practices where books co-exist with specific mental activities, know--how and motivational states*". Scholarly culture practice is like a "'block' whose existence necessarily depends on specific interconnectedness of material and non-material elements and which cannot be reduced to any one of these elements".
This involves interactions with other household members but also solitary activities with books, storytelling, imaginative play and vocabulary development. Parents who encourage their children to read and enjoy books contribute to their educational success through stimulating children's cognitive skills *but, here, their behaviour is routine practice and not concerted cultivation. Books and objects, such as e--readers, are not just disposable accessories to scholarly culture practices but constitute their integral part and motive*.

#### 2.2.2. Scholarly culture enhances success in school

Both detailed studies of individual countries and studies with a broad international sweep find that *children who come from bookish homes get better grades and perform at a higher level* on standardized tests than children who are otherwise comparable on stratification and demographic characteristics but come from families with smaller home libraries.
<--- 책 많은 집 아이들이 계층이나 기타의 인구통계학적 특징은 비슷하지만 홈 라이브러리 규모가 작은 집 아이들보다 더 높은 퍼포먼스를 보인다.

Research which sought to evaluate various aspects of home literacy environments in 25 societies found that household library size predicted school success already among fourth-graders net of the reported literacy activities undertaken with parents and net of parental attitudes to literacy.
Home libraries continue to facilitate students’ academic achievement in adolescence. The results on the standardized tests are particularly important because they are anonymously graded, so there is no teacher to be duped by potentially arbitrary cultural signals.

#### 2.2.3. Scholarly culture enhances educational attainment

With respect to educational gains, both detailed studies of individual countries and research projects with a global scope find that net of other influences, *children from homes with larger home libraries get more years of education overall and are also more likely to make all the major educational transitions*. This has held since at least the 1940s, holds for societies across the whole span of socioeconomic development, held for Communist societies as well as others, and holds for the disadvantaged groups for which it has been assessed.

#### 2.2.4. Scholarly culture enhances occupational success

This topic received less attention, but the evidence to date is that, in the 27 societies studied thus far, socialization into scholarly culture is associated with higher occupational attainment, primarily indirectly by raising educational attainment, but also with an extra lift beyond that.

#### 2.2.5. The effects are greatest for the most disadvantaged

As anticipated by the cultural mobility thesis, the effects of these cultural resources are strongest for people from the most disadvantaged homes. Assessment of functional forms of the effect of home library size on educational and occupational outcomes repeatedly shows that a log linear form fits better than a linear form.
The means that each additional book in a home library has much larger benefits for families that only possess a few books than for families that already possess many. This has been interpreted as the additional skills conferred per book: The first book you read opens a whole new set of operational skills and cognitive possibilities; each subsequent book continues to offer vocabulary expansion, new experiences in cognitive complexity and intellectual flexibility, but at a reduced rate.

#### 2.2.6. This paper's contribution: scholarly culture confers cognitive skills that last into adulthood

It has long been argued that cognitive assets are closely entwined with life chances.
The specific contribution of scholarly culture theory is that **cognitive skills are the “missing link” heretofore unmeasured directly in studies of the effects of book-oriented socialization on educational and occupational success**. We cannot here assess the specific mechanisms whereby book-oriented socialization instils cognitive skills and intellectual flexibility, although we argue that *it is through social practices in the family which make up a bookish way of life*, rather than the more instrumental concerted cultivation proposed in the cultural reproduction model.

That model relegates the role of books to merely one of many possible indicators of parental cultural capital in its objectified form, which is often individually owned and purchase--related. However, *book-oriented culture is a shared rather than individual resource*. Thus, in a twin study aimed at measuring individual capital, individual book ownership within twin pairs correlated at 0.994 which fits the concept of bookishness as a shared family practice. Moreover, *bookishness is more culturally acquired than purchase-oriented*. Books cost money but **family bookshelves might be filled with regular loans from libraries or bookish friends**.

Building on this evidence, the current paper extends scholarly culture theory *by demonstrating that bookishness as social practice, to which youth are acculturated, creates cognitive benefits which are not only immediate but also last into adulthood and are independent of educational and occupational standing* (although bookishness also significantly enhances both forms of attainment).

It might be argued that the rapid rise of digital literacy calls into question the relevance of bookish cultures for future generations, but we find no sign of a diminishing effect in more recent cohorts of PIAAC participants. We take up this question more deeply in the conclusion.

## 2.3. Hypotheses

Our hypotheses stem from an argument about broad benefits of *bookish socialization*. Hence, we expect similar outcomes for literacy, numeracy and ICT skills:

### Hypothesis 1

*Diminishing returns with greatest gains at the bottom*: Adult literacy, numeracy and ICT problem solving skills develop more when home libraries grow from tiny to medium than from large to enormous.

### Hypothesis 2

*Direct literacy benefits of growing up in scholarly culture*: Exposure to larger home libraries in adolescence enhances adult educational and occupational attainment, but it also boosts literacy, numeracy and ICT skills net of parental education or respondents' attainment in adulthood. *The impact on skill is contrary to the cultural reproduction claim that cultural resources confer arbitrary signals*.

### Hypothesis 3

*Life--long cumulative benefits of scholarly culture*: larger home libraries in adolescence benefit adult cognitive skills *through stimulating more engagement in out-of-work routine adulthood practices that maintain literacy, numeracy and ICT skills but also irrespective of these activities*.

## 3. Data, measurement and method

### 3.1. Data

### 3.2. Dependent variables

### 3.3. Independent variables

### 3.4. Omitted variables and measurement error

### 3.5. Method

## 4. Results

### 4.1. Home libraries vary in size from society to society

### 4.2. Greatest gains at the bottom: exposure to books in adolescence enhances adult literacy, numeracy and ICT skills

### 4.3. Books in adolescence enhance adult literacy, numeracy and digital problem-solving: total and direct effects

### 4.4. Bookish adolescents with lower secondary education credentials become as literate, numerate and technologically apt in adulthood as university graduates who grew up with only a few books

### 4.5. How do adolescent libraries matter? Path analyses: literacy as an example

<figure class="center">

</figure>

Adolescent bookishness influences adult outcomes in many ways. Path analyses, estimated in Mplus 7, show that adolescent home library size significantly enhances

- not only literacy,
- but also adult education,
- occupation
- and non-work routine reading activities (Fig. 3).

Because the patterns are similar for all three cognitive domains, the results for numeracy and ICT skills are in Supplementary materials

**Indirectly**, books benefit literacy mostly through *educational*, but also through *occupational* attainment as well as a boost from *routine reading practices* undertaken by adults.

Yet, the **direct effect** of books

- on *literacy* remains non-trivial at 0.157.
- The coefficient depicting the enhancement of *adult reading habits* by adolescent exposure to books is 0.218,
- with the greatest benefit occurring for *educational* attainment 0.300
- in contrast to 0.102 for occupational status.

Here, *the reading habits indicator is a predictor of literacy* because it gauges the frequency of activities that precede literacy tests taken by PIAAC respondents.
In sum, the benefits of bookishness for attainment are beyond question. **The direct effects of books on adult literacy and reading habits fit in with the scholarly culture argument** but not with theories of elite closure that are central to traditional cultural capital arguments.
Early exposure to books in parental home matters because *books are an integral part of routines and practices which enhance life-long cognitive competencies*.

## 5. Conclusion

### 5.1. Summary

1. **as anticipated by Hypothesis 2**: Our results show that adolescent exposure to books is an integral part of social practices that foster long term cognitive competencies spanning literacy, numeracy and ICT skills, as anticipated by Hypothesis 2.

2. **as anticipated by Hypothesis 3**: These competencies facilitate educational and occupational attainment, but they also lay a foundation for life--long routine activities that enhance literacy and numeracy, *irrespective of attainment*, as anticipated by Hypothesis 3.

3. **as Hypothesis 1 predicted**: Our findings from 31 societies surveyed between 2011 and 2015 support the scholarly culture argument and stand in opposition to the theory of cultural closure/cultural reproduction in which cultural capital has no relationship to concrete skills and, instead, functions as a signal that legitimises the social exclusion of non--elite persons. These results are robust to sensitivity tests and they also corroborate the expectation from scholarly culture theory that the first few books make the greatest contribution to cognitive skills of all three kinds, as Hypothesis 1 predicted. In other words, home library size has a *loglinear effect* on cognitive, numerical, and problem-solving skills that endure throughout life.

### 5.2. Discussion: the future of scholarly culture

We must consider the possibility that as knowledge societies move towards digital literacy and numeracy, the consumption of printed materials and books will become obsolete as an indicator of scholarly culture.

For now, however,

- the beneficial effects of home libraries in adolescence are large and hold in many different societies with no sign of diminution over time.
- Moreover, home library size is positively related to higher levels of digital literacy, so the evidence suggests that for some time to come, engagement with material objects of scholarly culture in parental homes, i.e. books, will continue to confer significant benefits for adult ICT competencies.

In the US,

- over 80% of readers who used e-books in 2011 already read many printed books which they supplemented with digital reading.
- Indeed, recent research indicates that reading printed rather than digital texts enhances comprehension and retention of information.
- Specifically, metanalyses of studies that compare reading of printed and digital materials point to the advantages of reading printed books for deep comprehension of complex content, retrieving specific information, and facilitating shared family reading time.

...

For the time being, however, the perception that social practice of print book consumption is passé is premature.

### 5.3. Discussion: how does scholarly culture confer cognitive skills?

"How does this come about?"
We will propose some possibilities for future research:

- **Role modelling**: Children emulate parents who *read*.
- **Acquisition of specific strategies proposed by significant others or discovered in books themselves**: children build “toolkits” of strategies that they apply in multiple situations (Swidler, 1986).
- **Stimulation of cognitive skills through family social practices**: books are interwoven with positive affect, specific mental activities, know--how, and motivational states. Storytelling, imaginative play, charades, and vocabulary development come to mind.

*We suggest that scholarly culture is a way of life rather than concerted cultivation*.
